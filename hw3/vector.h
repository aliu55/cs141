/** ADVISED ORDER OF IMPLEMENTATION
 * 1. Constructors
 * 2. Insertor (<<) -> allows you to print out and see what is in the vector throughout development
 * 3. Write test cases that use some of the constructors and print those vectors out
 * 4. Write a test case for a function
 * 5. Implement the function and test until you are confident on its correctness
 * 6. Repeat from 4 until all methods are implemented and tested
 * 7. Implement the destructor last; if there are still errors, then you know it is due to memory management
